Topical
=======

Topical is a publish/subscribe based messaging system organised around topics.

Users may subscribe and unsubscribe to messages in a topic and post messages to
any topic (even those they are not subscribed to). They can also request to
receive any messages from a topic in order to read them. Once a user has 
received a message they will not receive it again.
